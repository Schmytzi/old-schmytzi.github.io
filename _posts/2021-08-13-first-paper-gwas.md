My first paper, [*Genome-wide Association Study of Estradiol Levels and the Causal Effect of Estradiol on Bone Mineral Density*](https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgab507) was published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.

In this paper, we identified 15 loci associated with estradiol levels and quantified the causal effect of estradiol on bone mineral density.

Hi, I'm Daniel but most people call me Schmitzi!

I'm a bioinformatics PhD student in Uppsala, Sweden.
Before that, I was born and raised around Berlin and got my Bachelor's and Master's in Munich.

When I'm not busy doing research, I am politically active at [RFSL Uppsala](https://uppsala.rfsl.se), where I used to be chairperson.
In my free time, I like to play mahjong, pole dance and game.

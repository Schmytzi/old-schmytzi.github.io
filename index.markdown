Hi, I'm Daniel but most people call me Schmitzi!

I'm a bioinformatics PhD student in Uppsala, Sweden.
I work with whole-genome sequencing data in large cohorts to find links between genetic variants and complex traits.
Before that, I was born and raised around Berlin and got my Bachelor's and Master's in Munich.

Find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mNKN6GQAAAAJ) and [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4480-891X).
You can also download a [copy of my CV from GitHub](https://github.com/Schmytzi/cv/releases/latest/download/cv.pdf).

When I'm not busy doing research, I am politically active at [RFSL Uppsala](https://uppsala.rfsl.se), where I used to be chairperson.
In my free time, I like to play mahjong, pole dance and game.
